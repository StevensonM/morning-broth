                Is your portfolio down? Having a bad week? Just waking up from a one night stand with an attractive
                klepto named Rebecca who replaced all your most valuable possesions with little sticky notes

                While you may find yourself wanting to blow off steam in socially acceptable ways from the 1950s
                like kicking your dog, there are other ways to cope without insulting your masculine sensibilites and
                racking
                up a vet bill. Try
                smoking a cigar on the back porch. Still feeling blue? Practice the nunchucks whilst simultaneously
                smoking
                another, yet circumferentially
                larger cigar.

                Ted Cruz proposes legislation to restrict the sale of women's clothing to only females. The decision
                comes
                after attending a Harry Styles concert with his daughters in which the singer came out and sang
                Watermelon
                Sugar wearing a Pumpkin Patch-esque dress and hair bow.
            </p>
            <p>
                U.S. Representative Matt Gaetz rallied support for Cruz soon after relating the dangers of young men
                seeing the singer's
                dress wearing shenanigans to women seeing Elvis move his hips on stage for the first time.

                Fellow U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez spat back on Twitter stating that if her son wanted to wear a
                dress to school that she would let him, but only if he set his pronouns to (activist/champion) on
                LinkedIn.

                for the European market. Per Mark Gurman, the pen and paper set

                Kim Jong-un consigliere Dennis Rodman to negotiate
                Brittney Griner's release. DOJ spokeswoman Kerri Kupec called it a 'no-brainer' in a recent New York
                Times article. The news sent Russian officials spiralling. Per sources close to the
                Kremlin, Russia's Minister of Justice, Konstantin Chuychenko called it a 1,000 IQ move.

                ‚úÖ <strong>Norway fails the vibe check:</strong> After months of deliberation, the EU has decided to deny
                Norway's request to join the European Union. The decision comes off the back of recent questions
                regarding Norway's loyalty and fundamental motivations for joining. The country had considered joining
                in 1972 and 1994, but decided against it
                both times. Oh, now they want in because that nuclear arms wielding meglomaniac next door is all warmed
                up? The EU thins not. In a bombshell BBC interview about the decision, President of the European
                Council Charles Michel quoted Drake saying, in his best Toronto Mans accent, "Yeah, you ain't really
                f*ck with me way back then, but how 'bout now?"

                leading her fawn towards the tree line. As an adult, I look back on this moment often and think about
